# My first page in Streamlit

This is my first project learning to use the Streamlit Python library.

To enter it, here I leave the entry [link](https://buttersweet.streamlit.app/).

This page is a first test project on the use of the Streamlit library, it is about an old pastry business that I had in 2020, when due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I had to leave the one in That was my job then.

I wanted to use my own images and everything to give a style to the page. He still has a lot to improve, but I keep practicing. It contains:

- A sidebar for selecting a specific page to view.
- Use of animations, they are loaded from [Lottie](https://lottiefiles.com/); To use the animations, it is necessary to have the streamlit-lottie library installed.
- A contact form, so that the person can make any possible queries. At the moment it has a classic Google form installed, but later, the idea is to change it and place one more in line with the design of the page.
